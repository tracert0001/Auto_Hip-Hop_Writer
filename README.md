Automatic English Hip-Hop Lyrics Writer

Hip-Hop/Rap is a modern form of poetry. Great rap lyrics are personal and flow like water, blending into the song while making a point or theme like a great essay or story might.
Like a burgeoning writer needs to study the best poets, a growing rapper needs to read to the great rappers for inspiration. However it seems that the ideas occur to the writer unpredictably and likely no correlation between them is guaranteed.   
Furthermore, it is hard for certain rappers to write lyrics with a variety of styles. To summarize, how to expand a few of ideas to a paragraph, find materials, and make words varied but coherent is the most challenging part of rap lyrics writing.
